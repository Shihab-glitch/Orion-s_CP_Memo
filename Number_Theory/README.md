# Number Theory

This folder contains implementations of various number theory algorithms used in competitive programming.

## Subfolders

- **Primality/** - Prime number algorithms (Sieve of Eratosthenes, Prime checking, etc.)
- **GCD_LCM/** - GCD and LCM algorithms (Euclidean algorithm, Extended Euclidean, etc.)
- **Modular_Arithmetic/** - Modular operations (Modular inverse, Chinese Remainder Theorem, etc.)
- **Factorization/** - Prime factorization techniques (Trial division, Pollard's rho, etc.)
- **Combinatorics/** - Permutations, combinations, binomial coefficients
- **Exponentiation/** - Fast exponentiation, modular exponentiation

## Tips

- Include time and space complexity in comments
- Handle edge cases (0, 1, negative numbers)
- Consider overflow for large numbers
- Use modular arithmetic where applicable
