# Orion's Competitive Programming Memo

A repository to store and organize my Competitive Programming practice codes and solutions.

## 📚 Structure

This repository is organized into the following categories:

- **Algorithms/** - Implementation of various algorithms
  - Sorting
  - Searching
  - Graph Algorithms
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Divide and Conquer
  
- **Data_Structures/** - Implementation of various data structures
  - Arrays and Strings
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Heaps
  - Hash Tables
  
- **Problem_Solving/** - Solutions to problems from various platforms
  - Codeforces
  - LeetCode
  - HackerRank
  - CodeChef
  - AtCoder
  
- **Contest/** - Code from programming contests
  
- **Templates/** - Useful code templates and snippets

## 🚀 Usage

Each folder contains code files with descriptive names. Problem solutions include comments with:
- Problem name and link
- Problem description
- Approach/Algorithm used
- Time and Space complexity

## 📝 File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `binary_search.cpp`, `merge_sort.py`
- For problems: `platform_problemname.ext` (e.g., `cf_two_sum.cpp`, `lc_valid_parentheses.java`)

## 💻 Languages Used

- C++ (Primary)
- Rust (Planned)
- Java (Planned)
- Python (Planned)

## 📌 Notes

This is a personal practice repository to track my competitive programming journey and improvement.
