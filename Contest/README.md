# Contest

This folder contains code from programming contests I've participated in.

## Organization

Organize by contest name and date:
- `ContestName_YYYY-MM-DD/`
  - `problem_A.cpp`
  - `problem_B.cpp`
  - `README.md` (with contest link and results)

## Tips

- Keep original contest code for reference
- Note what worked and what didn't
- Review and learn from mistakes
